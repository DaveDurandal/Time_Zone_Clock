This is a very basic time zone clock I made a few years ago. I made it while working with people in multiple time zones. I found it to be very handy for Eve Online gameplay shedules as well.

Very easy to get running, start running it with python and it will pop right up. 

This project needs a few things: 
    Daylight Savings Time (DST) - This is not accounted for in the program AT ALL, but due to the difficultly of different locations have different days when this takes effect and other locations not ever having it, made the program rather messy. In future versions, I will add a toggle at the top so the user can activate DST on or off. 
    Selectable Time Zones - I've hard-coded the current time zones, the ability to add and remove the needed time zones would be more beneficial for others.
